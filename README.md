========================

So, I put [QSV Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/c/QSVGaming)'s in his How To Make An Undertale Fangame series together into a GameMaker: Studio 2 project.

The series is cool, you should check it out!

## License

I don't really know. [QSV's code repo](https://github.com/TheRealQSV/UT-CodeSnippets) may have one soon, and if it does, I'll use the license it uses.
